# Automated-Health-Graph-Generator

To derive meaningful insights from voluminous healthcare data, it is essential to convert it into machine understandable knowledge. Currently, machine understandable domain specific healthcare knowledge curation framework does not exist for complete body of human. By these automated systems helps in monitoring and recording all the vital information of a particular patient by maintaining all the records. Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information

when we have to upload these final report of the health,its automatically converting in to the .CSV file and its producing the origianl output its format of the Graph.

# outcome of the health  graph generator

The Automated Health Graph Generator can be results in Simple, Easy to Use and more Efficient.
The final Result of this Project is that the giving a exact output of graphical representation on time.
Itâ€™s saves time, resources as well
